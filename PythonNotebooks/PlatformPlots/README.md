# Platform plots

Notebooks to generate plots for different types of in situ platforms that can be found in CMEMS.

* Read_TimeSeries_1.ipynb: load variables from a local netCDF file.
* Read_TimeSeries_2.ipynb: load variables from a file available in a [thredds data server](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/)
* Read_TimeSeries_3.ipynb: use the [cf-module](http://cfpython.bitbucket.org/) to load a variable knowing its [CF standard name](http://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html).
* Read_drifter_data_1.ipynb: read a netCDF file containing a surface drifter trajectory.
* Read_drifter_data_2.ipynb: scatter plot using the data from the previous example.
* Read_drifter_data_3.ipynb: creation of a gridded field using the same data.
* plot_CMEMS_*.ipynb: reads and represents data from various types of platforms (mooring, research vessel, profiler, drifter).
* plot_positions_latest_global.ipynb: plot all the data locations available for a given day in the latest directory.
