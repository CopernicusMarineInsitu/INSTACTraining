# Index file plots

How to read and represent the information stored in the Index files available in the CMEMS FTP.
These files are meant to contain the list of platforms with their temporal and spatial coverage as well as the complete file name so that the users can select the files or interest prior to the download.

* read_CMEMS_indexfile.ipynb: read the index file and represent the data on a map.
* IndexFile_Folium_Visalization.ipynb: create a leaflet map with the positions of the platforms.
